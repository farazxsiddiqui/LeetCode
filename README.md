[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/farazxsiddiqui/)

Here are the solutions of the problems that I solve on LeetCode.

I use Java for solving these questions because I feel that the said language is an interesting one and it's one of the most asked-for languages today. Being proficient in Java is a must nowadays.

I am currently a beginner so my solutions might not be the most optimal but they will do the job just as good, alternatively you can use this repository as a guide to selecting problems to practice on LeetCode as I am currently solving those questions that are frequently asked in FAANGM interviews and are recommended by many brilliant online tutors i.e. Kunal Kushwaha from [Community Classroom](https://www.commclassroom.org/).

*I try to update the repository every weekend!*

Would love to connect with you! Let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-faraz-siddiqui/).
